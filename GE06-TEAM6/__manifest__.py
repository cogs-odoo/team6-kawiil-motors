Motorcycle Registry
====================
K'awiil Motors doesn't want to confuse its employees by having to keep track of both a VIN and a serial number. They also wish for a VIN to be generated immediately when a Manufacturing Order is created. Currently, they are using Odoo's serial number tracking on their motorcycle products. They require the serial number to be generated in the format of their VIN.
